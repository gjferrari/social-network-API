# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users could share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. For this application I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. To format timestamps I used the the native JavaScript `Date` object. In order to test the api, I used Insomnia to test all routes; you can watch a walk-through video of that process in the video section
